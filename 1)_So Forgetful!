So this was a basic chall just needed to open the pacap and view it
I used Wireshark and opened the file here :

1) i applyed this filter 'tcp.stream eq 5'
2)i got a string in password 'S04xWjZQWFZ5OQ%3D%3D'
3)it was base 64 decoded it and got 'KN1Z6PXVy9'

wraped the formate vishwaCTF{KN1Z6PXVy9}
and solved it
