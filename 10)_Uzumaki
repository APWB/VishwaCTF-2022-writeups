So it was a HARD challange Steps :

1)I used IDA to decompile you can se any
2)I will see margesort and spiralOrder function when i decompiled it 
3)I needed to return 1 from the spiralOrder function for that i have to bypass all the switch statement with correct input
4)I needed to set breakpoints at the if conditions in switch cases
5)After that check the compare value of the dl and al register to find the correct value
6)I noteded all the valuses on paper and then bypassed it and got the flag
7) Flag was : vishwactf{_1_@m_@_w33b_}
