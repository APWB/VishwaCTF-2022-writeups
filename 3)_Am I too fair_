Easy Challange Steps :

1)There are 8 different emojis
2)so thought of octal. Also total 45 emojis
3)each character in octal is 3 digits
4)So octal checks out
5)We need to form 15 characters. 
6)Each octal ascii code starts with 0 or 1
7)So I bruteforced a bit so that each set gives out valid characters and proper meaning full words which was the flag
8)Flag was : vishvaCTF{F0RB1DD3N_FRU1T}
