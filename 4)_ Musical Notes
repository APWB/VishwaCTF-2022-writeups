So it was a Easy chall Steps :

1)I viewed the hint 'All Chores Encloses Rare Encrypted cipher' so i was knowing there is a chiper called acer chiper decoded it and got another encoded text which was aes beacuse in description its written SEA so if we revers it we get AES and i used the key as listentocoolsong mode was ECB
2) Got the flag : vishwaCTF{mus1c4l_c1ph3r_1n_4ct10n}
