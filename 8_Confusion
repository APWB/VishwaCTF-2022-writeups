Nice Challange Steps :

1)open and decompile the binary
2)set break at main. just jump over to the username input ,after the input it decrypt a string which is 'NiceOne!-_' 
3)The algorithm to genarate password of usernames is like this: s = 'NiceOne!-_' s[i] ^ len(user_name) == password[i]
4)so i use the following script to genarate the password for the user:
###~user_name = 'nLYTCmdXobFRhs'
s = 'NiceOne!-_'
for i in range(len(s)):
	print((len(user)^ord(s[i])),end='_')
print(len(user))~###

5)And We Got The Flag : vishwaCTF{64_103_109_107_65_96_107_47_35_81_14}
