Chall name: Corrupted image

We see that the file extension is .bmp

a quick search on bmp header tells us that the bmp file signature is 42 4d f6 04 00 00

Editing the first few bytes of the image with 42 4d f6 04 00 00 in a hex editor like ghex and HxD, will make the pic complete 

now the image opens and the flag is written there
