#Again a random numbers guessing chall but wait there is a seed
#i wrote the random generator in c

#where NOUNCE changes every second
#now with python code i can get the current time and give it as NOUNCE in my generator to get numbers
#so i just ran my python code + the chall file at same time(say with a difference less than a second)
#inputted the numbers and got the flag
